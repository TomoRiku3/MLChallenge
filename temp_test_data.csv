For example, even the simplest French dish like a creamy vegetable stew requires six main ingredients: potatoes, broccoli, carrots, butter, salt, and parsley. Similarly, a typical Chinese stir-fry often involves a variety of components, including a primary ingredient (like chicken or tofu), supporting vegetables (such as bell peppers or onions), seasonings (like soy sauce, oyster sauce, sugar, and salt), and additional aromatics (such as garlic, ginger, or scallions). Whether it's Western or Asian cuisine, the number of ingredients often depends on the complexity of the dish and the layering of flavors.","Week day lunch,Week day dinner,Weekend lunch,Weekend dinner,At a party,Late night snack","it depends on.
